# Introduction

Getting started with the **XRPL EVM Sidechain** takes only a few minutes: install a wallet, connect it to the network, and fund it with XRP. This page walks you through each step and points you to the right guide when you need more detail.

## Create a Wallet

To interact with the XRPL EVM Sidechain, you need a compatible wallet such as **MetaMask** or **Keplr**. Your wallet is your gateway to the network: it manages your accounts, signs your transactions, and connects you to dApps.

- Learn how to [Install MetaMask](./install-metamask.md).
- Connect your wallet to the XRPL EVM Sidechain by following the [Connect MetaMask to the XRPL EVM](./connect-to-the-xrpl-evm.md) guide.

- Learn how to [Install Keplr](./install-keplr.md) and add the XRPL EVM Sidechain Network to your wallet.

## Obtain XRP for Transaction Fees

{% tabs %}
{% tab label="Mainnet" %}
Every action on the XRPL EVM Sidechain, such as deploying smart contracts or transferring tokens, requires a small amount of **XRP** to cover transaction fees. There are several convenient ways to obtain XRP for the XRPL EVM Sidechain:

---

### Option A: Gas Refuel with Gas.zip

The easiest way to get started is by using **[Gas.zip](https://www.gas.zip)**, a cross-chain **gas refuel service**.
Gas.zip lets you send small amounts of native tokens (like ETH, BNB, or MATIC) from a supported source chain and receive **XRP directly on the XRPL EVM Sidechain** to cover your transaction fees.

- Supports **300+ destination chains**, including XRPL EVM.
- Built on **LayerZero cross-chain messaging** for secure settlement.
- Optimized for low-friction, small transfers (between ~$0.25 and ~$50 per chain).

This is the fastest way to “top up” your wallet with just enough XRP to start interacting with the XRPL EVM Sidechain.

### Option B: Cross-Chain Swap with SquidRouter

Use Squid to swap tokens from any connected chain to XRP on the XRPL EVM Sidechain directly.
→ [Try Squid](https://app.squidrouter.com)

---

### Option C: Exchange Transfer

1. **Buy XRP on a centralized exchange** that supports XRPL EVM Sidechain withdrawals
2. **Withdraw directly** to your XRPL EVM Sidechain wallet address

---

### Option D: Bridge / On-Ramp From the XRP Ledger (XRPL)

If you already hold XRP on the **XRPL mainnet**, you can bring it over to the XRPL EVM Sidechain using supported wallets and Squid Router. Many XRPL wallets also integrate **fiat on-ramps**, so you can purchase XRP directly before bridging.

#### Supported XRPL Wallets for Squid Router (XRPL → XRPL EVM)

| Wallet                                             | Notes / Features                           | On-Ramp / Fiat Integration                                          |

#### Steps to Bridge XRP → XRPL EVM

1. **Install / configure your XRPL wallet**

   - Choose one of the supported wallets (Crossmark, Xaman, Joey, Girin, Bifrost, or XRPL MetaMask Snap).
   - Ensure your XRPL account is activated (requires ~1 XRP base reserve).

2. **(Optional) On-Ramp to XRP**

   - Buy XRP directly within supported wallets:

     - **Xaman** → MoonPay
     - **Joey** → MoonPay
     - **Bifrost** → Topper (Uphold)
     - **XRPL MetaMask Snap** → Transak

3. **Bridge with Squid Router**

   - Open [Squid Router](https://app.squidrouter.com) and select **XRPL → XRPL EVM**.
   - Connect your XRPL wallet and authorize.
   - Enter the XRP amount and destination XRPL EVM address.
   - Sign the transaction and confirm the bridge.

4. **Receive XRP on XRPL EVM Sidechain**

   - Once the bridge completes, the XRP will be available in your XRPL EVM wallet (e.g. MetaMask).
   - You can now use it for gas, transfers, or smart contracts.

### Option E: Cosmos Ecosystem Swap with Skip Go

[Skip Go](https://go.skip.build/) enables swaps from Cosmos-based chains (e.g., Osmosis, Injective, Elys Network, Cosmos Hub, Noble and others.) to XRPL EVM Sidechain using Cosmos IBC
→ [Try Skip](https://go.skip.build/?src_asset=uatom&src_chain=cosmoshub-4&dest_asset=axrp&dest_chain=xrplevm_1440000-1&amount_in=&amount_out=)

{% /tab %}
{% tab label="Testnet" %}

Every action on the XRPL EVM Sidechain, such as deploying smart contracts or transferring tokens, requires a small amount of **XRP** to cover transaction fees. There are two ways to get XRP for the **XRPL EVM Sidechain Testnet**:

1. **Use the Faucet**:  
   The XRPL EVM Sidechain Faucet allows you to request free test XRP for development purposes.  
   _(Read more: [Faucet](../faucet.md))_

2. **Bridge XRP from the XRP Ledger**:  
   Transfer XRP from the XRP Ledger to the XRPL EVM Sidechain using available **Bridge** services.  
   _(Read more: [Transfer XRP with Bridge Services](../using-the-bridge/transfer-xrp-with-axelar.md))_
