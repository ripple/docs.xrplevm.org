### Start Building and Exploring

Once your wallet is set up and funded with XRP, you're ready to explore the XRPL EVM Sidechain's functionalities:

- **Deploy Smart Contracts**: Use tools like Remix IDE or Hardhat to deploy Solidity-based smart contracts natively on the XRPL EVM Sidechain.  
  _(Read more: [Deploy a Smart Contract](../../developers/interacting-with-evm/deploy-the-smart-contract.md))_

- **Interact with Smart Contracts**: Use libraries like `ethers.js` or `web3.js` to interact with deployed contracts programmatically.  
  _(Read more: [Interact with a Smart Contract](../../developers/interacting-with-evm/interact-with-the-smart-contract.md))_

- **Build Native dApps**: Take advantage of fast finality and low costs to create high-performance decentralized applications.

- **Optional Cross-Chain Features**: When needed, explore available bridge services for multi-chain functionality.

## Getting Started with XRPL EVM Sidechain

### Create a Wallet

To interact with the XRPL EVM Sidechain, you need a compatible Ethereum wallet such as **MetaMask** or **Keplr**. This wallet will serve as your gateway to manage accounts, sign transactions, and deploy smart contracts on the XRPL EVM Sidechain.

- Learn how to [Install MetaMask](./install-metamask.md).
- Connect your wallet to the XRPL EVM Sidechain by following the [Connect MetaMask to the XRPL EVM](./connect-to-the-xrpl-evm.md) guide.

- Learn how to [Install Keplr](./install-keplr.md) and add the XRPL EVM Sidechain Network to your wallet.

### Obtain XRP for Transaction Fees

{% tabs %}
{% tab label="Mainnet" %}
Every action on the XRPL EVM Sidechain, such as deploying smart contracts or transferring tokens, requires a small amount of **XRP** to cover transaction fees. There are several convenient ways to obtain XRP for the XRPL EVM Sidechain:

---

### **Option A: Direct Purchase with Gas.zip**

The easiest way to get started is to purchase XRP directly on the XRPL EVM Sidechain using fiat currency.
→ [Visit Gas.zip](https://www.gas.zip)

---

### **Option B: Cross-Chain Swap with SquidRouter**

Use Squid to swap tokens from any connected chain to XRP on the XRPL EVM Sidechain directly.
→ [Try Squid](https://app.squidrouter.com)

---

### **Option C: Exchange Transfer**

1. **Buy XRP on a centralized exchange** that supports XRPL EVM Sidechain withdrawals
2. **Withdraw directly** to your XRPL EVM Sidechain wallet address

---

### **Option D: Bridge from XRPL**

If you already have XRP on the XRP Ledger, you can bridge it to the XRPL EVM Sidechain:

1. **OnRamp XRP using the XRPL MetaMask Snap or any other XRPL Wallet**
   The XRPL MetaMask Snap includes a built-in OnRamp via [transak.com](https://transak.com/)
   → [Visit the XRPL MetaMask Snap](https://snap.xrplevm.org)

2. **Bridge XRP from the XRP Ledger to XRPL EVM Sidechain**
   Use available **Bridge** services to transfer XRP from the XRP Ledger to XRPL EVM Sidechain.
   → [Read more: Transfer XRP with Bridge Services](../using-the-bridge/transfer-xrp-with-axelar.md)

---

### **Option E: Cosmos Ecosystem Swap with Skip Go**

Skip Protocol enables swaps from Cosmos-based chains (e.g., Osmosis, Injective) to XRPL EVM Sidechain.
→ [Try Skip](https://go.skip.build/) 

---

### **Option F: Receive XRP from another user**

The simplest way to get started is to ask a friend or teammate to send you some XRP on the XRPL EVM Sidechain.
Make sure to provide them with your **XRPL EVM Sidechain wallet address** (same as your MetaMask address).


{% /tab %}
{% tab label="Testnet" %}

Every action on the XRPL EVM Sidechain, such as deploying smart contracts or transferring tokens, requires a small amount of **XRP** to cover transaction fees. There are two ways to get XRP for the **XRPL EVM Sidechain Testnet**:

1. **Use the Faucet**:  
   The XRPL EVM Sidechain Faucet allows you to request free test XRP for development purposes.  
   _(Read more: [Faucet](../faucet.md))_

2. **Bridge XRP from the XRP Ledger**:  
    Transfer XRP from the XRP Ledger to the XRPL EVM Sidechain using available **Bridge** services.  
    _(Read more: [Transfer XRP with Bridge Services](../using-the-bridge/transfer-xrp-with-axelar.md))_
