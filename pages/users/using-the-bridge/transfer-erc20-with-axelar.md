# Transfer ERC20 with Axelar

You can transfer tokens from other EVMs to the XRPL and XRPL EVM using [Squidrouter](https://app.squidrouter.com/) as well as the other way round.

In this example, we will transfer WBTC from Ethereum to XRPL EVM!

1. **Set** Ethereum as the **source chain**, XRPL EVM as the **destination chain** and WBTC as the **asset** to transfer.
