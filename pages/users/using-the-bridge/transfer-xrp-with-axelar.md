# Transfer XRP with Axelar

The Axelar Bridge connects multiple blockchain networks, enabling secure asset transfers across the XRPL ecosystem and beyond. This guide explains how the bridge works and highlights the key differences between **Testnet** and **Devnet** setups.

## Understanding the Axelar Bridge

- **Cross-Chain Transfers:** Seamlessly move assets (e.g., XRP, IOUs, ERC20 tokens) between XRPL, XRPL EVM, and other connected chains.  
- **Interoperability:** Unlock new possibilities for dApps, services, and users by allowing access to assets and functionalities across different blockchains.
