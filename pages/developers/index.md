Welcome to developing on the **XRPL EVM Sidechain**! This guide will help you build decentralized applications on a high-performance blockchain that combines the best of both worlds.

## What is the XRPL EVM Sidechain?

The XRPL EVM Sidechain is a **Cosmos SDK-based blockchain** that provides full support for **Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) smart contracts**. This unique architecture gives you:

- **EVM Compatibility**: Deploy Solidity smart contracts with full Ethereum tooling support
- **Cosmos SDK Foundation**: Benefit from fast finality, low fees, and modular architecture
- **Interoperability**: Native support for IBC (Inter-Blockchain Communication) and cross-chain bridges
