# How to Deploy a Subgraph with Goldsky CLI

Goldsky makes it easy to index smart contracts with a powerful no-code subgraph configuration system. Using the interactive CLI wizard, you can deploy a fully working subgraph in minutes.

## üöÄ Step-by-Step Guide to Deploy a Subgraph

### 1. Launch the Wizard

Start the Goldsky wizard:

```bash
goldsky subgraph init
```

---

### 2. Set Subgraph Name and Version

You‚Äôll be prompted to enter a name and version:

```
Subgraph name: nouns-demo
Subgraph version: 1.0.0-demo+docs
```

---

### 3. Define Target Path

Set the target path where all configuration files will be saved:

```
Subgraph path: ~/my-subgraphs/nouns-demo/1.0.0-demo+docs
```

---

### 4. (Optional) Set ABI Source

You may skip this step to allow Goldsky to fetch ABI files automatically:

```
Contract ABI source: (leave blank)
```

---

### 5. Enter Contract Details

Provide the smart contract address:

```
Contract address: 0x9C8fF314C9Bc7F6e59A9d9225Fb22946427eDC03
```

Select the network:

```
Contract network: mainnet
```

Set the start block (autodetected or manually entered):

```
Start block: 12985438
```

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è **For XRPL EVM**
> See [Supported Networks](https://docs.goldsky.com/chains/supported-networks) for correct network IDs including XRPL Mainnet and Testnet.

---

### 6. Name the Contract

Provide a human-readable name:

```
Contract name: NOUNS
```

---

### 7. Enable Call Handlers (Optional)

To also index function calls:

```
Enable subgraph call handlers? Yes
```

---

### 8. Confirm & Initialize

Review your setup:

```
Proceed with subgraph initialization? Yes
Proceed with subgraph build? Yes
```

---

### 9. Deploy the Subgraph

Deploy to Goldsky‚Äôs indexing service:

```
Proceed with subgraph deploy? Yes
```

* **GraphiQL API:**
  `https://api.goldsky.com/api/public/.../subgraphs/nouns-demo-mainnet/1.0.0-demo+docs/gn`

---

## üîç Query Your Subgraph

After deployment, test your subgraph using GraphiQL:

```graphql
query LatestNouns($count: Int = 5) {
  nounCreateds(first: $count, orderBy: tokenId, orderDirection: desc) {
    id
    block_number
    transactionHash_
    timestamp_
    tokenId
    seed_background
    seed_body
    seed_accessory
    seed_head
    seed_glasses
  }
}
```

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Non-Interactive Deployment (CI/CD)

To automate deployment (e.g., for CI pipelines):

```bash
goldsky subgraph init nouns-demo/1.0.0 \
  --contract 0x9C8fF314C9Bc7F6e59A9d9225Fb22946427eDC03 \
  --network mainnet \
  --start-block 12985438 \
  --contract-name NOUNS \
  --call-handlers \
  --deploy
```
